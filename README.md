# Git Workflow: Fork, Branch, Commit, Pull, and Push

This guide explains the **full Git workflow** for contributing to a project safely and efficiently. It covers **forking**, **branching**, **committing**, **pulling updates**, and **pushing changes**, along with best practices and warnings.

---

## 1. Fork the Repository

**When to do:**  
- When you want to contribute to someone else's repository.  
- When you don’t have write access to the original repository.

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
2. Click the **Fork** button at the top-right corner.
3. GitHub will create a copy of the repository under your account.

**When NOT to do:**  
- Do **not** fork if you are the owner of the repository; just clone it.

---

## 2. Clone Your Fork Locally

**When to do:**  
- Immediately after forking, to work on the code locally.

**Steps:**
1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Click **Code** and copy the HTTPS or SSH URL.
3. Clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <your-fork-url>
````

4. Navigate to the **root folder** of the project:

```bash
cd <repository-folder>
```

**Important:** Always start at the **root folder**. Creating branches or pushing from subfolders can cause issues.

---

## 3. Set Up the Original Repository as a Remote

**When to do:**

* If you want to keep your fork updated with the latest changes from the original repository.

**Steps:**

```bash
git remote add upstream <original-repo-url>
git remote -v
```

* `origin` = your fork
* `upstream` = original repository

**Tip:** Only set this up once per clone.

---

## 4. Create a New Branch

**When to do:**

* Always create a new branch for every feature or bug fix.
* Never work directly on `main` branch.

**Steps:**

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
```

* Use descriptive names: `feature/login-fix`, `bugfix/navbar-crash`.

**When NOT to do:**

* Do **not** create a branch deep inside a subfolder. Always create it from the root.

---

## 5. Make Changes Locally

**Steps:**

1. Navigate to any folder and make your changes.
2. Check the status:

```bash
git status
```

3. Stage changes from the root folder:

```bash
git add .
```

Or stage specific files:

```bash
git add path/to/file.js
```

4. Commit your changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Add descriptive message"
```

**Tips:**

* Commit frequently with small, meaningful changes.
* Always commit from the root folder.
* Do **not** commit temporary files or compiled binaries.

---

## 6. Push Your Branch to Your Fork

```bash
git push origin feature/my-new-feature
```

**Tips:**

* Push often to save your work.
* Only push feature branches, not `main`.

---

## 7. Pull Future Changes from Original Repository

**When to do:**

* Before starting new work on a branch.
* When collaborating, to avoid conflicts.

**Steps:**

1. Fetch updates:

```bash
git fetch upstream
```

2. Switch to main:

```bash
git checkout main
```

3. Merge updates:

```bash
git merge upstream/main
```

4. Push merged changes to your fork:

```bash
git push origin main
```

5. Update your feature branch if needed:

```bash
git checkout feature/my-new-feature
git merge main
```

**When NOT to do:**

* Do **not** merge `main` into your feature branch without reviewing changes first.

---

## 8. Create a Pull Request (PR)

**Steps:**

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Click **Compare & pull request** next to your branch.
3. Add a title and description.
4. Submit the PR to the original repository's **main branch**.

**Tips:**

* PR should be clear and focused on one feature or bug fix.
* Always review your commits before creating a PR.

---

## 9. Common Mistakes to Avoid

* Committing directly to `main`.
* Creating branches inside subfolders.
* Pushing without pulling the latest updates first.
* Not using descriptive commit messages.
* Forgetting to stage files (`git add`) before committing.
